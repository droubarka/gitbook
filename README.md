# Introduction

## Operating System

An **Operating System (OS)** is essential software that manages computer hardware and software resources. It provides a user interface, handles file management, memory allocation, and process scheduling, allowing multiple applications to run smoothly. Examples include Windows, macOS, Linux, Android.

### What is a Program?

In computing, a **program** is a set of instructions that a computer follow to perform specific tasks or operations. Programs written in programming languages, which provides a way for humans to communicate with computers in a structured manner.

#### Key Components of a Program:

* **Instructions:** A program consists of instructions that tell the computer what to do. These instructions can include calculations, data processing, input/output operations, and control flow (like loops and conditionals).
* **Programming Language:** Programs are typically written in high-level programming languages (like Python, Java, C++, etc.) or low-level programming languages (like Assembly language). High-level languages are more abstract and easier for humans to read, while low-level languages are closer to machine code.
* **Source Code:** The human-readable version of a program is called "**Source Code**". This code must be compiled or interpreted into machine code (Binary) for the computer to execute it.
* **Execution:** When a program runs, the computer's processor executes the instructions in the program, performing the tasks specified by these instructions.
* **Functionality:** Programs can perform a wide range of functions, from simple calculations to complex operations like managing databases, processing images, or running web servers.

### Types of Programs

* **Application Software:** These are programs designed for end-users to perform specific tasks, such as word processing, web browsers, and games.
* **System Software:** These include operating systems (like Windows, macOS, Linux) That manage computer hardware and provide services for application software.
* **Utility Programs:** These programs perform maintenance tasks, such as antivirus software, disk management tools, and file compression utilities.

### Summary

A program is a structured set of instructions that enable a computer to perform specific tasks, and it is a fundamental concept in computer science and software development.
